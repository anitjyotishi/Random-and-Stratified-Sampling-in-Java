Hello,
If you wish to execute this on eclipse, the folder BigData is the project folder. Project can be run by importing the contents of this folder on eclipse.

Project can also be executed through command prompt. To do so, go to the folder Without Eclipse and run Main.java.

The input file chosen is "Complex9_GN8.txt".Other details about the technical and other specifications can be found in the comments in code. 

Thank you,
